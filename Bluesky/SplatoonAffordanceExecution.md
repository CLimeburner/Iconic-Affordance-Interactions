# Splatoon Affordances Execution

## Painting

Dual camera + projector setup detecting projected light or laser reticles onto surfaces, and projecting the ink as appropriate. The Graffiti Research Lab seems to already have a model (https://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/blitztag/) that could be adjusted for this purposes, so I'll be looking into that as a software base. Certainly if this was done for a laser-tag style maze, the projector and camera requirements would be pretty bonkers unless it was very open and could use just a few top-down devices towards the floor.

## Eliminating Opponents

Possibly just a conventional lasertage setup? I.e. vest with sensors.

## Mobility

Not sure. Variable mobility seems difficult to achieve in physical space, though maybe just increasing the fluidity of mobility in a constant fashion would be sufficient. Perhaps using rollerblades or using haunt slider gear? Both of these options may prove too dangerous depending on what the play course looks like.

Adding an update to this section, a friend reminded me of the existence of heelys the other day. What about a set of heelys equipped with brake pads, so that you could still walk/run in them, but could also roll over areas your team has inked. Brake pads would activate in sections you haven't inked, to simulate the differential in mobility. Using break pads should increase friction to kill the sliding, without a dangerous "lock out" on the wheels that could happen mid-roll. Not an immediate priority, but I want to start thinking about it as an option.
