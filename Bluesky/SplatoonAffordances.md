# Splatoon Affordances Observation notes

This is just a brief document to record my observations of what affordances seem to make Splatoon tick as a game.

- Targeting environment to cover territory, not neccesarily other players
- Swimming through inked areas at high speed (heightened mobility)
  - Can only use ink of the same colour
  - Can hide (low vertical profile)
- Live map overview of game arena
- Only horizontal surfaces count in turf wars, though vertical surfaces help with mobility
  - Some surfaces can't be inked
  - Some surfaces cannot be physically bypassed but can be shot through (ex. grates)
- Health bar
  - Damaged by both running and swimming through ink of opponent's colour
  - Sufficient damage causes a respawn at base
  - Healing happens very slowly automatically
  - Healing happens automatically much faster when swimming
- Weapons with varying patterns of coverage
- Weapon-dependant ink usage
  - Ink slowly refills automatically
  - Ink refills much faster while swimming in one's own ink
