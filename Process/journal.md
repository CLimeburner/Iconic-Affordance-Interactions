# Process Journal

## Off to the Races - Tuesday, Mar. 14, 2023

Standing where I am, at the beginning of this project, there are a few pretty big procedural questions I'm going to have to figure out aside from the project itself. Namely, since I'm designing tangible interfaces, how will documenting that manifest in the commit history. I definitely don't have to figure this all out right away, as not all of it will immediately be necessary, but I foresee likely having a lot of weird file types in this repository. Certainly lots of text for thoughts and brainstorming, various software files like Arduino code and TouchDesigner patches, 3D sculpt files in Blender, etc. I guess we'll see where it leads with file size, but I'm gonna sorta play this by ear for now and re-evaluate if it proves to be an issue. As I reach a stage of having working prototypes, I may also have to consider a way to archive photos and videos from playtests.

As for the more substantive side of the project, since I'm creating a themed tangible interface in a vacuum, I will probably begin by brainstorming ideas from popular culture. Normally in a theme park context, I'd be a little constricted by the general theme chosen, but for the purposes of this project I don't think I need to immediately bind my hands to, say, a specific IP. Indeed, as part of my initial research, I suggest that if an overarching theme doesn't have any readily appealing interactions, then maybe the themed experience doesn't need to be interactive at all. As such, I think I'll begin by creating a text file to just vomit interactions onto, and then when I feel I've reached a good critical mass (or really run out of ideas) I'll review them to see what's promising and plausible to turn into a playful experience. In this initial brainstorm, I also don't think I'll limit myself by what's already been done, as I think there probably **is** something to be said for reinventing the wheel, if you find a different and uninteresting way to do it. In surveying theme park interactivity, there are certainly several pairs of the same nominal interaction (driving cars, flying spaceships, casting spells, shooting web) that are executed differently, and although in many of these cases there seems to have been a "correct" choice, i son't want to immediately assume that's always the case. Alright, off to go set up a document to brainstorm and I'll probably check back in once I have some sort of list compiled.
