## Off to the Races - Tuesday, Mar. 14, 2023

Standing where I am, at the beginning of this project, there are a few pretty big procedural questions I'm going to have to figure out aside from the project itself. Namely, since I'm designing tangible interfaces, how will documenting that manifest in the commit history. I definitely don't have to figure this all out right away, as not all of it will immediately be necessary, but I foresee likely having a lot of weird file types in this repository. Certainly lots of text for thoughts and brainstorming, various software files like Arduino code and TouchDesigner patches, 3D sculpt files in Blender, etc. I guess we'll see where it leads with file size, but I'm gonna sorta play this by ear for now and re-evaluate if it proves to be an issue. As I reach a stage of having working prototypes, I may also have to consider a way to archive photos and videos from playtests.

As for the more substantive side of the project, since I'm creating a themed tangible interface in a vacuum, I will probably begin by brainstorming ideas from popular culture. Normally in a theme park context, I'd be a little constricted by the general theme chosen, but for the purposes of this project I don't think I need to immediately bind my hands to, say, a specific IP. Indeed, as part of my initial research, I suggest that if an overarching theme doesn't have any readily appealing interactions, then maybe the themed experience doesn't need to be interactive at all. As such, I think I'll begin by creating a text file to just vomit interactions onto, and then when I feel I've reached a good critical mass (or really run out of ideas) I'll review them to see what's promising and plausible to turn into a playful experience. In this initial brainstorm, I also don't think I'll limit myself by what's already been done, as I think there probably **is** something to be said for reinventing the wheel, if you find a different and uninteresting way to do it. In surveying theme park interactivity, there are certainly several pairs of the same nominal interaction (driving cars, flying spaceships, casting spells, shooting web) that are executed differently, and although in many of these cases there seems to have been a "correct" choice, i son't want to immediately assume that's always the case. Alright, off to go set up a document to brainstorm and I'll probably check back in once I have some sort of list compiled.

## Circling Back - Sunday, Apr. 16, 2023

So I'm writing this right before I jump back into this project from a short hiatus. When I left off, I'd just realized I'd run afoul of my own design principles and so felt I needed to realign a little bit. Although I haven't been working on this project actively for a little while, I *have* been thinking about it on the back burner. I'm going to add to my blue sky document, but this time I'm gonna start with some top lists of popular video games, movies, or books, and try to see which affordances stand out most prominently.

Dropping a list of top watched Twitch games into my document, I'm immediately struck at how many are just fps-based. Probably about half of them are in some measure shooting oriented, with many of those being explicitly just about thooting each other, so maybe shooting really just is a superlatively popular mechanic. One thing that does also strike me at first blush, however, is that again there's considerable variability in the aesthetic and mechanical space around shooting as a core affordance. For instance, Overwatch has a very different tone from Counter Strike, and games like Fortnite or Resident Evil have considerably more than just shooting, such as dancing, building, and puzzles.

One of those last examples, Fortnite, is of particular interest to me, because I know the dance emotes within the game, while popular cosmetics, are also occasionally invoked as gameplay mechanics, such as Taco Time and the Boogie Bomb. I can't say I know all that much about Fortnite or the precise public opinion on these uses of the emotes, but I think it merits further investigation, as the interaction of shooting and dancing seems pretty unique other than maybe a tenuous connection to wild west "making someone dance" scenarios. With a bit more research, this might be a promising initial design to start prototyping in some sort of dance-mediated laser tag situation.

One particular caution I want to just set down here specifically so I can check-in on it later, is that I am very cognizant that a list of popular games to *watch* may not neccesarily reflect popular games to play, so as I go about my analysis, I'll probably be looking to draw in some lists of popular games, perhaps from Steam play time or some such metric.
