## Initial Motivations - Tuesday, Mar. 14, 2023

For this project, I'm setting out to design tangible interactive objects or interfaces that appeal to existing aspirations from transmedial sources. This builds upon theoretical research I previously conducted, a truncated version of which was presented at the Themed Experience and Attractions Academic Symposium in 2022 (talk can be found [here](https://youtu.be/ppZmP93QfYY)). The main thrust of the argument is that themed tangible interactivity exists at the intersection of traditional themed entertainment and video games, and as such, requires a greater sensitivity to principles from both. Specifically, designs need to be driven by existing audience desires around transmedial sources (shooting guns, swinging swords, playing guitars) rather than just any interaction that can technically be shoehorned into an experience. This is an important consideration because many interactive theme park experiences become reduced to proven tech platforms, which then get redeployed over and over in uncompelling-to-baffling ways. Examples of this issue are the pervasiveness of shooting dark rides, even when the gun is a wrench, and phone apps that ultimately have little to no relation to the physical surroundings of the park. The full paper, which I'm currently preparing for submission, outlines five principles that I think can help focus the design process so that it doesn't get stuck in a well of proven technologies, or uninteresting activities. They are as follows:

1. Once a high concept theme has been selected, interactive design must proceed from the bottom-up, driven by the specificity of affordances rather than broad roles from within the selected theme.
2. Themed tangible interactivity should be designed from “iconic” gestures or affordances.
3. Themed tangible interactivity should facilitate guest competence and the subjective experience of mastery, either directly or through diegetically justified challenge.
4. Themed interactive experience should aim to capture both input and feedback modalities of the simulated affordances.
5. Themed tangible interactivity should dissimulate its means of interactivity, not only hiding them, but rendering them experientially transparent.

Some of these principles can be endlessly elaborated, but the general idea is to design some objects, consciously follow this principles, and see if a) it works, and b) any concrete methodology for applying the principles emerges from the process.
