# Prototype v001 Description

## Shooting

Drawing on The Graffiti Research Lab's blitzTag (https://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/blitztag/) as a basic tech model, this first prototype focuses on getting a "paint shooting" mechanic working using a conventional laser pointer, webcam, projector, and laptop running TouchDesigner. Essentially, a laser pointer is capable of being much brighter than anything else in a given visual frame, allowing for the creation of a TouchDesigner setup that will filter by luminance to extract laser hits and use that as data points for output graphics to the projector on the same surface. See accompanying Diagram.jpg file.

## Mobility

Mobility may not get actually prototyped for this first version, but I want to at least start laying down some groundwork for later prototypes. I've been thinking a lot about how to get fast-paced action broadly, and roller skates and ice skates both immediately come to mind. Certainly ice skates would also come with a built-in white surface to project on. However, these avenues for mobility are both going to be more dangerous because of their speed, perhaps even more so if the experience requires low-light conditions, and do little to really replicate the specific affordances of Splatoon. Obviously this will require greater thought at a later date.
