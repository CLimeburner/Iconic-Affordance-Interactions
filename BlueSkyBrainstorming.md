# Blue Sky brainstorming

This will be a list of all my ideas for possible tangible interactive interfaces based on desirable activities from various media, either in general, or specific to an IP.

**Prop-based** (involves a portable object)
- Shooting guns
  - This is a "classic" but I do think there's some depth to this one that usually gets collapsed into concerns around guns. The actual affordance is a bit broader than guns and can be understood in ways that apply to wiffleball canons and bows as well, so this might merit some deeper elaboration.
- Building on the above, Arm canons
  - Such as in Metroid or Mega Man
- Swinging swords/other weapons
  - Similarly classic to the above guns, and similarly has some nuance. Do people have the same desires around a lightsaber as they do around a medieval sword or an ax?
- Playing instruments
  - Most obviously rock instruments
- Fishing with a rod/net
- Throwing a Pok√©ball
- The various camera operations in Pokemon Snap
- Casting spells with a wand/staff/orb/cauldron
- Possibly riffing on the above, brewing potions
- Various sports operations?
  - Baseball bat, hockey stick, throwing various types of balls, pole vaulting, etc
  - Some of these could go under gesture-based where it's more about your body moving through space than about the bat/ball/etc.
- Picking up and throwing various breakable vessels
  - Such as pots in Legend of Zelda or barrels in Donkey Kong
- Search for treasure with a map
- Searching for some MacGuffin
  - I'm thinking here about IP that have conspicuous "homing" tools, like the magic compass from Pirates of the Caribbean, or sci-fi RADAR
- Viewing through a spy glass of some kind
  - Magnifying glass, telescope, binoculars, I guess tourist viewfinders and camera as well?
- Eating iconic foods/Drinking iconic drinks
  - Harry Potter Candy, butter beer, lembas bread from Lord of the Rings, the Eat Me and Drink Me items in Alice in Wonderland, Duff beer, etc.
- Dressing in distinctive ways (uniforms, costumes)
  - Both IP specific and drawn from culture
- Cultural crafts (origami, shadow puppetry, etc)

**Environment-based** (involves an interface in the built environment)
- Hacking with a keyboard
  - This could also fit under prop-based if it was a portable hacking device like a tablet, but I'm going to put it here for now.
- Swing from web/vine/whip
  - respectively referencing Spiderman, Tarzan, and Indiana Jones
  - Again, this could go with prop-based, but I'm thinking these are more about relations to swingable space than necessarily about a given realization of swinging.
- Falling down a rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland
  - This could maybe also fall under gesture-based?
- Cross a rope bridge
  - Trope of many adventure stories, could have potential?
- Shopping in a themed environment
  - Ex.: Diagon Alley from Harry Potter is specifically a shopping district
- Rock/net/rope climbing
- Punching the blocks in a Super Mario land

**Vehicle-based** (involves piloting/riding something, realizing this is sorta environmental but also sorta prop-based?)
- Riding a horse
- Ride a motorcycle
- Driving a car
- Piloting a spaceship/plane/mech
- Piloting a sailing ship?
  - Do people care about pirate-style helming?
- Riding the train

**Gesture-based** (involves the unaugmented body performing gesture as main focus)
- Matrix bullet time
- Martial arts
- Jumping in a Super Mario land
  - This could feasibly me environment-based as well
- Flying
  - Superman-style, for example
- Dancing
- Fire breathing
