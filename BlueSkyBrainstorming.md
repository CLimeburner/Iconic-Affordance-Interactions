# Blue Sky brainstorming

This will be a list of all my ideas for possible tangible interactive interfaces based on desirable activities from various media, either in general, or specific to an IP.

- Shooting guns
  - This is a "classic" but I do think there's some depth to this one that usually gets collapsed into concerns around guns. The actual affordance is a bit broader than guns and can be understood in ways that apply to wiffleball canons and bows as well, so this might merit some deeper elaboration.
- Building on the above, Arm canons
  - Such as in Metroid or Mega Man
- Swinging swords/other weapons
  - Similarly classic to the above guns, and similarly has some nuance. Do people have the same desires around a lightsaber as they do around a medieval sword or an ax?
- Playing instruments
  - Most obviously rock instruments
- Hacking with a keyboard
- Fishing with a rod/net
- Swing from web/vine/whip
  - respectively referencing Spiderman, Tarzan, and Indiana Jones
- Throwing a Pok√©ball
- The various camera operations in Pokemon Snap
- Casting spells with a wand/staff/orb/cauldron
- Possibly riffing on the above, brewing potions
- Various sports operations?
  - Baseball bat, hockey stick, throwing various types of balls, pole vaulting, etc
- Riding a horse
- Ride a motorcycle
- Driving a car
- Piloting a spaceship/plan/mech
- Picking up and throwing various breakable vessels
  - Such as pots in Legend of Zelda or barrels in Donkey Kong
- Piloting a sailing ship?
  - Do people care about pirate-style helming?
- Search for treasure with a map
- Viewing through a spy glass of some kind
  - Magnifying glass, telescope, binoculars, I guess tourist viewfinders and camera as well?
- Shopping in a themed environment
  - Ex.: Diagon Alley from Harry Potter is specifically a shopping district
- Eating iconic foods/Drinking iconic drinks
  - Harry Potter Candy, butter beer, lembas bread from Lord of the Rings, the Eat Me and Drink Me items in Alice in Wonderland, Duff beer, etc.
- Dressing in distinctive ways (uniforms, costumes)
  - Both IP specific and drawn from culture
- Riding the train
- Falling down a rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland
- Cultural crafts (origiami, shadow puppetry, etc)
- Jumping in a Super Mario land
- Matrix bullet time
- Martial arts
