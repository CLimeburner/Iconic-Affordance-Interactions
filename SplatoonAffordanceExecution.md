# Splatoon Affordances Execution

## Painting

Dual camera + projector setup detecting projected light or laser reticles onto surfaces, and projecting the ink as appropriate. The Graffiti Research Lab seems to already have a model (https://www.graffitiresearchlab.de/blitztag/) that could be adjusted for this purposes, so I'll be looking into that as a software base. Certainly if this was done for a laser-tag style maze, the projector and camera requirements would be pretty bonkers unless it was very open and could use just a few top-down devices towards the floor.

## Eliminating Opponents

Possibly just a conventional lasertage setup? I.e. vest with sensors.

## Mobility

Not sure. Variable mobility seems difficult to achieve in physical space, though maybe just increasing the fluidity of mobility in a constant fashion would be sufficient. Perhaps using rollerblades or using haunt slider gear? Both of these options may prove too dangerous depending on what the play course looks like.
